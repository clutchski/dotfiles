This file guides Claude Code on my coding principles and preferences.

## Coding Principles

- Practice test driven development. Before we write code, write tests that model the behavior we want to see. Run them and make sure they fail before we implement the solution. Then try to solve the problem and verify the tests work. Keep iterating.
- Make a plan. Think hard about the steps you need to take to solve a problem. Show me your plan before you start working.
- Don't commit code or push branches. I will.
